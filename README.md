# Advent of Code 2022 - Rust oneliner edition

AoC 2022 in Rust, but

- the `main` function must contain a single `println!` call that prints the answer and nothing else;
- any closure can contain only one statement (if-then-else counts as one statement);
- only `itertools` and `regex` crates are allowed.

Extra challenge: try solving the problem with the shortest possible line :)
